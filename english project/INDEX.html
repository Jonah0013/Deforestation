        <h2>Why is deforestation an issue?</h2>
        <p>
          This is an issue because trees help to put oxygen out and take in
          carbon dioxide by photosynthesis this is useful as humans produce
          too much carbon dioxide and use up oxygen so trees can do the
          opposite of that meaning us humans can breathe for longer. However
          if we cut down the trees they can’t do that meaning eventually we
          won’t have enough oxygen to breathe. Another reason that
          deforestation is bad is that forests are homes to many species that
          could go extinct if we cut down all the trees and it is not only the
          home to animals it is the home to the indigenous people.

        <h2>Who is affected by deforestation?</h2>
        <p>
          There are many things that get effected by deforestation: <br>
          - Indigenous people <br>
          - Tribal people<br>
          - Endangered animals<br>
          - Animals<br>
          - The environment and in some way it would effect all of human kind<br>

        <p>- Between 1990 and 2020 the world has lost over 80 million hectors of primary forest. <br>
          - Agriculture drives over 90% of the world rainforest loss.<br>
          - Compared to current levels we need to cut down deforestation by 72% by 2032 in order to limit global warming
          to 1.5⁰C.<br>
          - In Glasgow at COP26 145 countries agreed to “halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.”<br>
          - In 2023, the loss of humid tropical primary forests was over a third higher than what is required to be
          showing that the world is not on track to meet this target.</p>

        <p>- Studies show that last month UK imports of forest-risk commodities in 2024 alone caused deforestation of a
          natural forest the size of Liverpool.<br>
          - In 2021 the environmental act schedule 17 was implemented to see the ban of illegally produced commodities
          on deforested lands or in contravention of local land laws. But it is not operational as it needs secondary
          regulations.<br>
          - The UK export £5.5bn of commodities to the UE each year. Meaning from the start of 2025 they needed to
          comply with the UE regulations.</p>

        <p>- In the UK law there should be a rule requiring traceability of all shipments of commodities entering the UK
          down to the farm level and ensure all companies implement measures to reduce deforestation.<br>
          - Secondary regulations should specify a variety of relevant local laws against which companies must verify
          the legality of their supply chains, including Indigenous customary laws, anti-corruption, labour, and
          environmental laws.<br>
          - The current government should follow through schedule 17 and ban all products linked to deforestation and
          require companies to closely monitor any human rights risks.</p>

        <p>- The government could also engage with producer countries to support local forest governance. However for
          this to work both countries would have to be transparent and inclusive with the indigenous people, local
          communities, and trade unions.<br>
          - The UK government must show global leadership and drive action to protect the world’s forests and the
          communities dependent on them. This begins by adopting – and then strictly enforcing – ambitious legislation
          at home to halt UK consumers unwitting contribution to deforestation and related human rights abuses.</p>
